### *I Can't Lose You* is a new addition to Frozen on Broadway

> If you loved yourself the way I do  
> Then you'd see why I can't lose you

Taking the place of *For The First Time In Forever (Reprise)*, this new song more deeply
explores the sisters' motivations and desperation.

For weeks, the only way fans could hear the song was by low-quality phone recordings
from live performances. Fortunately, the song was finally performed on air recently, and now we
have a much clearer track to listen to.

Similar to the song it replaces, it's introduced by a brief adaptation of
*Let It Go (Single Version)*; however, this first verse was excluded from the on-air
performance, leaving us with an incomplete song.

The solution? Splicing in the intro recorded for *Forever (Reprise)* by the original cast.
Now we have a full song!

The odds are high that Disney will take that video down eventually. When they do, it will
be re-uploaded here, so bookmark this page!
